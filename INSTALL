Installing pychm
================

Requirements
------------

* Python >= 2.2
* chmlib
* A working C compiler

Installation from sources
-------------------------

python setup.py install

Tip - if the compilation is failing because your chmlib is installed somewhere
not visible to gcc, then you can use the CPATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment
variables before trying to compile:

CPATH=<directory where chmlib include files are> \
LIBRARY_PATH=<directory where the chmlib library is> \
python setup.py install
