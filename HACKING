Hacking on pychm
================

PyCHM uses the functionality implemented in chmlib, a C-based library written by
Jed Wing. The functionality is lifted into Python using SWIG.

Additional requirements
-----------------------

* SWIG if you want to regenerate the sources from the interface file.

Regenerating SWIG sources
-------------------------

If you are feeling adventurous and want to re-generate the C source file from
the SWIG interface file (src/swig_chm.i), then all you need to do is modify the
setup.py file and substitute src/swig_chm.c with src/swig_chm.i
(tested with SWIG 1.13.18).
