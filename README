pychm 0.5.0
===========

Summary
-------

  PyCHM contains a Python package named chm to manipulate CHM files.

  The chm package contains two modules, namely chm.chm and chm.chmlib. 
chm.chmlib is a low level wrapper module around the API provided by the 
C library chmlib, written by Jed Wing <jedwin@ugcs.caltech.edu>. Quoted 
from Jed's README:

" chmlib is a small library designed for accessing MS ITSS files.  The 
ITSS file format is used for Microsoft Html Help files (.chm), which 
have been the predominant medium for software documentation from Microsoft 
during the past several years, having superceded the previously used .hlp 
file format."

 Please refer to chmlib documentation on more details of what is supported or
not.

  chm.chm provides some high level functionality over chm.chmlib, such as
access to the .chm file contents tree.

Requirements
------------

  * Python 2.2 (older versions may work, I dont know)
  * chmlib-0.31 (this is the one I used, older/newer versions may/may not work)
  * A working C compiler if you plan to build the sources.
  * SWIG *if* you really want to regenerate the sources from the interface
    file (but this is not needed - keep reading). To get SWIG, go to
    http://www.swig.org

Installation
------------

    First you need to get Python and chmlib at:

    http://www.python.org
    http://66.93.236.84/~jedwin/projects/

    and install both of these packages.

  Installation from sources
  -------------------------

    If you are getting one of the source files, then all you need to do is
    unpack it, 'cd' to the newly created 'chm-X.X.X' directory and type:

    python setup.py install

    And that should be all. Note that you will probably need to have admin 
    privileges to do that if you are planning to install it on the base python
    modules directory.

    If you are feeling adventurous and want to re-generate the C source file
    from the SWIG interface file (src/swig_chm.i), then all you need to do
    is modify the setup.py file and substitute src/swig_chm.c with
    src/swig_chm.i (I used SWIG 1.13.18 to develop this).

  Installation from binaries
  --------------------------

    Just grab your favorite binary format, and install it according to your
    system's procedures (since you know which format you want, I am 
    assuming you know how to install it :)

    RPM installation
    ----------------

      Since chmlib (the C library) does not come in a RPM package, you
      need to install pychm like this:

      rpm --nodeps -i pychm-X.X.X-X.i386.rpm

Acknowledgements
----------------
  This work would not have been possible without the existence of chmlib,
developed by Jed Wing, and a lot of the python code used to parse the
contents tree and to decode the index files was heavily based on the
code implemented by Razvan Cojocaru <razvanco@gmx.net> for the xCHM
viewer.

FAQ
---

  Q. I want to re-generate the C source from the swig interface file! How
     do I do that?
  A. Modify the setup.py file and substitute src/swig_chm.c with
     src/swig_chm.i (I used SWIG 1.13.18 to develop this).

  Q. I am getting this "failed dependencies - libchm.so.0" error when I
     try to install the RPM. What have I done wrong?
  A. Make sure you downloaded and installed chmlib first. Then look
     at the item "RPM installation" on how to install the RPM package.
