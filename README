Summary
-------

  PyCHM contains a Python package named chm to manipulate CHM
archive. It uses the functionality implemented in chmlib, a C-based
library written by Jed Wing. Quoted from Jed's README:

"chmlib is a small library designed for accessing MS ITSF files.  The
ITSF file format is used for Microsoft Html Help files (.chm), which
have been the predominant medium for software documentation from
Microsoft during the past several years, having superceded the
previously used .hlp file format."

  The chm package contains four modules:

  * chm._chmlib: Low level wrappers around the chmlib API, generated by
    SWIG
    <jedwin@ugcs.caltech.edu>.
  * chm.chmlib: Low level wrappers around the chmlib API, also generated
    by SWIG;
  * chm.extra: Extra utility functions - right now, it contains a 
    function to perform full-text search support to extract LCID.
  * chm.chm: High-level support for CHM archives, using the functions
    from the modules above.

Requirements
------------

  * Python >= 2.2 (older versions may work, I dont know)
  * chmlib
  * A working C compiler if you plan to build the sources.
  * SWIG *if* you really want to regenerate the sources from the interface
    file (but this is not needed - keep reading). To get SWIG, go to
    http://www.swig.org

Installation
------------

    First you need to get Python and chmlib at:

    http://www.python.org
    http://66.93.236.84/~jedwin/projects/chmlib

    and install both of these packages.

  Installation from sources
  -------------------------

    If you are getting one of the source files, then all you need to do is
    unpack it, 'cd' to the newly created 'pychm-X.X.X' directory and type:

    python setup.py install

    And that should be all. Note that you will probably need to have admin 
    privileges to do that if you are planning to install it on the base python
    modules directory.

    If you are feeling adventurous and want to re-generate the C source file
    from the SWIG interface file (src/swig_chm.i), then all you need to do
    is modify the setup.py file and substitute src/swig_chm.c with
    src/swig_chm.i (I used SWIG 1.13.18 to develop this).

    Tip - if the compilation is failing because your chmlib is installed
    somewhere not visible to gcc, then you can use the cPATH and
    LIBRARY_PATH environment variables before trying to compile:

    (if you are using bash, or sh-like shells)
    export CPATH=<directory where chmlib include files are>
    export LIBRARY_PATH=<directory where the chmlib library is>

    or

    (if you are using tcsh, csh, etc)
    setenv CPATH <directory where chmlib include files are>
    setenv LIBRARY_PATH <directory where the chmlib library is>

  Installation from binaries
  --------------------------

    Just grab your favorite binary format, and install it according to your
    system's procedures (since you know which format you want, I am 
    assuming you know how to install it :)

    RPM installation
    ----------------

      Just do (but make sure you have chmlib installed first):

      rpm -i pychm-X.X.X-X.i386.rpm

Acknowledgements
----------------
  This work would not have been possible without the existence of chmlib,
developed by Jed Wing, and a lot of the python code used to parse the
contents tree and to decode the index files was heavily based on the
code implemented by Razvan Cojocaru <razvanco@gmx.net> for the xCHM
viewer.

FAQ
---

  Q. I want to re-generate the C source from the swig interface file! How
     do I do that?
  A. Modify the setup.py file and substitute src/swig_chm.c with
     src/swig_chm.i (I used SWIG 1.13.18 to develop this).
