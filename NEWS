---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.7.0

  * Added support to search for words inside CHM archives. This was
    implemented in a separate module (chm.extra) and is used in
    chm.chm.
  * Added method to CHMFile to read the archive encoding, so that 
    python codecs can be used to encode/decode contents of html files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.6.0

  * Removed IndexParser and other tree-related classes and functions from
    chm.py (chm.chm), because the tree structure was causing memory leaks
    in gnochm. GetIndex and GetTopics now return raw text. HTML parsing
    is not done inside the chm package anymore.
  * Documentation added to the Python wrappers in chm.py
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.5.0

  * First public release
